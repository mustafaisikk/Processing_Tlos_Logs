WARNING: Your system is scheduled to expire on January 5, 2021, which is 34 days from now. The SAS System will no longer function 
         on or after that date. Please contact your SAS Installation Representative to obtain your updated SAS Installation Data 
         (SID) file, which includes SETINIT information.
To locate the name of your SAS Installation Representative go to http://support.sas.com/repfinder and provide your site number 
70166440 and company name as ENERJISA -TOROSLAR - DATA MANAGEMENT ADV PROD.. On the SAS REP list provided, locate the REP for 
operating system AIX 64.
NOTE: Additional host information:
