WARNING: Your system is scheduled to expire on July 30, 2020, which is 5 days from now. The SAS System will no longer function on 
         or after that date. Please contact your SAS Installation Representative to obtain your updated SAS Installation Data (SID) 
         file, which includes SETINIT information.
To locate the name of your SAS Installation Representative go to http://support.sas.com/repfinder and provide your site number 
70166440 and company name as ENERJISA -TOROSLAR - DATA MANAGEMENT ADV PROD.. On the SAS REP list provided, locate the REP for 
operating system AIX 64.
NOTE: Additional host information:

IBM AIX AIX 64 2 7 00C9C0374C00 

You are running SAS 9. Some SAS 8 files will be automatically converted 
by the V9 engine; others are incompatible.  Please see
